        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2017 in the heart of Hollywood, Dave’s Hot Chicken started as a simple pop-up in a parking lot, quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon with a cult following. Our founder, Chef Dave, began with a passion for bold flavors and a simple mission: to serve the best hot chicken outside of Nashville.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each piece of our chicken is expertly cooked to perfection, using a secret blend of spices that has been meticulously crafted to ensure every bite is as memorable as the last. Our signature dish, the “Fire Fowl Slider”, combines crispy chicken with coleslaw and pickles, all drizzled with Dave’s special sauce, creating a taste sensation that keeps our fans coming back for more.
        </p>
        <p>
